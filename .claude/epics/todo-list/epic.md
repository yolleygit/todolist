# Epic: todo-list

## Overview
Implementation of a lightweight, client-side personal task management web application using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with localStorage for data persistence. The solution emphasizes simplicity, performance, and zero external dependencies.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Pure Frontend Approach**: Single-page application with no server requirements
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks to minimize complexity and load time
- **localStorage API**: Browser native storage for data persistence
- **Responsive Design**: CSS Grid/Flexbox for mobile-first responsive layout
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with JS
- **Component-based Structure**: Modular JS functions for maintainability

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
- **Task Input Component**: Form input with validation and submit handling
- **Task List Component**: Dynamic list rendering with CRUD operations
- **Task Item Component**: Individual task with checkbox, text, and delete functionality
- **Storage Manager**: localStorage wrapper with error handling and data validation
- **UI Controller**: Event handling and DOM manipulation coordination

### Backend Services
- **Not Applicable**: Fully client-side implementation

### Infrastructure
- **Static Hosting**: Can be served from any static web server or file system
- **No Build Process**: Direct HTML/CSS/JS files for immediate deployment
- **Browser Compatibility**: ES6+ features with fallbacks for older browsers

## Implementation Strategy
### Phase 1: Core Structure (MVP)
- HTML skeleton with semantic structure
- Basic CSS styling for clean UI
- JavaScript task model and localStorage integration

### Phase 2: Interactive Features
- CRUD operations implementation
- Event handling and DOM updates
- Input validation and error handling

### Phase 3: Polish & Performance
- Responsive design refinements
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations

### Risk Mitigation
- localStorage quota handling with graceful degradation
- XSS prevention through proper input sanitization
- Cross-browser testing for compatibility

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing across target browsers
- Edge case testing (storage limits, invalid inputs)
- Performance testing with large task lists

## Task Breakdown Preview
High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] HTML Structure: Create semantic HTML foundation with proper accessibility
- [ ] CSS Styling: Implement responsive design with clean, modern interface
- [ ] JavaScript Core: Build task model and localStorage persistence layer
- [ ] CRUD Operations: Implement create, read, update, delete functionality
- [ ] UI Interactions: Add event handling and dynamic DOM updates
- [ ] Input Validation: Implement client-side validation and sanitization
- [ ] Error Handling: Add robust error handling for storage and edge cases
- [ ] Testing & Polish: Cross-browser testing and accessibility improvements

## Dependencies
### External Dependencies
- Modern web browser with HTML5/CSS3/ES6+ support
- localStorage API availability (>99% browser support)

### Internal Dependencies
- None (self-contained implementation)

### Development Dependencies
- Text editor or IDE
- Modern web browser for testing
- Optional: HTTP server for local development

## Success Criteria (Technical)
### Performance Benchmarks
- Initial page load: <1 second (target: <500ms)
- Task operations: <100ms response time
- Support 1000+ tasks without performance degradation

### Quality Gates
- Zero JavaScript errors in browser console
- 100% localStorage persistence reliability
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsiveness (320px+ screen widths)

### Acceptance Criteria
- All CRUD operations function without page refresh
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Proper error handling for all edge cases

## Estimated Effort
### Overall Timeline
- **Total Effort**: 8-12 hours of development
- **MVP Delivery**: 4-6 hours
- **Full Feature Set**: 8-12 hours

### Resource Requirements
- Single frontend developer
- No additional tooling or infrastructure needed

### Critical Path Items
1. localStorage implementation (highest risk)
2. DOM manipulation performance with large lists
3. Cross-browser compatibility testing
4. Input sanitization and validation

### Development Phases
- **Phase 1 (2-3 hours)**: HTML structure + basic styling
- **Phase 2 (3-4 hours)**: Core JavaScript functionality
- **Phase 3 (2-3 hours)**: Polish, testing, and optimization
- **Phase 4 (1-2 hours)**: Cross-browser testing and bug fixes
