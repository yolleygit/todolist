# Task: JavaScript Core and Storage Manager

## Description
Build the core JavaScript task model and localStorage persistence layer. Create a robust data layer that handles task storage, retrieval, and persistence with proper error handling and data validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create app.js with modular task management system
- [ ] Implement Task class/object model with proper data structure
- [ ] Build StorageManager class with localStorage wrapper
- [ ] Add error handling for localStorage quota and availability
- [ ] Implement data validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create utility functions for task manipulation

## Technical Details
- Task data model: {id, text, completed, createdAt, updatedAt}
- localStorage wrapper with try/catch error handling
- Data validation for all task properties
- Graceful fallback when localStorage unavailable
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- ES6+ features with browser compatibility considerations

## Dependencies
- [ ] No dependencies (can be developed alongside HTML)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (independent of HTML/CSS)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Task model implemented
- [ ] localStorage integration working
- [ ] Error handling for all storage operations
- [ ] Data validation implemented
- [ ] Code is modular and well-structured
