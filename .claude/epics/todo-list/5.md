# Task: CRUD Operations Implementation

## Description
Implement create, read, update, delete functionality for tasks. Build the core business logic that handles all task operations with proper data persistence and validation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement createTask() function with validation
- [ ] Build readTasks() function for data retrieval
- [ ] Create updateTask() function for editing task text and completion status
- [ ] Implement deleteTask() function with confirmation
- [ ] Add task ID generation and management
- [ ] Ensure all operations persist to localStorage

## Technical Details
- CRUD operations with proper error handling
- Unique ID generation (UUID or timestamp-based)
- Task validation (text length, required fields)
- Optimistic updates with rollback on failure
- Batch operations for performance
- Data integrity checks

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 003: Core JavaScript and storage manager must be complete

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on storage layer)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All CRUD operations implemented
- [ ] Data validation working
- [ ] Operations persist correctly to storage
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] Functions are well-tested manually
