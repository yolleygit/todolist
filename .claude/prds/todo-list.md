## Executive Summary

A simple, efficient personal task management web application that allows users to create, organize, and track their daily tasks. The application provides a clean, intuitive interface for managing personal productivity without the complexity of team collaboration features.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Many individuals struggle to keep track of their daily tasks and maintain productivity. Existing solutions are often overcomplicated with features for team collaboration, complex project management, or require cloud accounts and subscriptions.

**Why is this important now?**
Users need a lightweight, privacy-focused task management solution that works entirely in the browser with local storage, providing immediate access without registration or internet dependency.

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona
**Individual User**: A person who wants to manage personal tasks efficiently without external dependencies or complex features.

### Detailed User Journeys

**Story 1: Task Creation**
- As a user, I want to quickly add new tasks so that I can capture thoughts and responsibilities as they occur
- Acceptance Criteria: User can add tasks with a simple input field and submit button

**Story 2: Task Organization**
- As a user, I want to view all my tasks in a clear list so that I can see what needs to be done
- Acceptance Criteria: Tasks are displayed in a clean, readable list format

**Story 3: Task Completion**
- As a user, I want to mark tasks as complete so that I can track my progress
- Acceptance Criteria: User can check/uncheck tasks, completed tasks are visually distinguished

**Story 4: Task Management**
- As a user, I want to edit or delete tasks so that I can keep my list current and accurate
- Acceptance Criteria: User can modify task text or remove tasks entirely

**Story 5: Data Persistence**
- As a user, I want my tasks to be saved when I close the browser so that I don't lose my data
- Acceptance Criteria: Tasks persist using browser local storage

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
1. **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks with descriptive text
2. **Read Tasks**: Display all tasks in an organized list
3. **Update Tasks**: 
   - Edit task text inline
   - Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
4. **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list
5. **Data Persistence**: Automatically save to browser local storage

**User Interface:**
- Clean, minimalist design
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile browsers
- Intuitive controls (buttons, checkboxes, input fields)
- Clear visual feedback for actions

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Page load time under 2 seconds
- Instant response to user interactions
- Smooth animations and transitions

**Security:**
- No sensitive data transmission (fully local)
- Input sanitization to prevent XSS
- Data validation on all inputs

**Scalability:**
- Handle up to 1000 tasks without performance degradation
- Efficient local storage usage
- Graceful handling of storage limits

**Usability:**
- Intuitive interface requiring no tutorial
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes:**
1. User can create a task in under 5 seconds
2. Task list loads and displays within 1 second
3. All CRUD operations work without errors
4. Data persists between browser sessions 100% of the time
5. Application works offline completely

**Key Metrics:**
- Task creation success rate: 100%
- Data persistence reliability: 100%
- Cross-browser compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile responsiveness: Works on screens 320px and wider

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must work entirely in browser (no server required)
- Local storage size limitations (typically 5-10MB)
- Browser compatibility requirements
- No external API dependencies

**Timeline Constraints:**
- MVP should be completable in 1-2 development sessions
- No complex features that require extensive development time

**Resource Constraints:**
- Single developer implementation
- No budget for external services or hosting
- No design resources beyond basic CSS frameworks

**Assumptions:**
- Users have modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
- Users understand basic task management concepts
- Local storage is acceptable for data persistence
- No need for data backup or export initially

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
1. User authentication or accounts
2. Cloud synchronization
3. Team collaboration features
4. Advanced task categorization or tagging
5. Due dates and reminders
6. File attachments
7. Task templates
8. Reporting and analytics
9. Third-party integrations
10. Mobile native apps
11. Offline-first PWA features (beyond basic offline functionality)
12. Data export/import functionality
13. Task prioritization levels
14. Task search functionality

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Modern web browser with localStorage support
- Basic HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript compatibility

**Internal Dependencies:**
- None (self-contained application)

**Development Dependencies:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge
- Basic understanding of localStorage API
- Optional: CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind for styling

## Implementation Notes

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- Storage: Browser localStorage API
- No backend required
- Optional CSS framework for styling

**Key Technical Considerations:**
- localStorage has size limitations
- Handle localStorage quota exceeded errors
- Implement basic data validation
- Consider graceful degradation for older browsers
